    <h2>Description</h2>

        <b>Duck a l'orange is one of those classic dishes that somehow became a clich√©, and people stopped making it for fear of looking un-cool, which is too bad, since it's really good. This is traditionally done with a whole roasted duck, but by using duck breasts we get pretty much the same results in a lot less time.</b>
